Others argue that renewable sources of energy are the best pathway towards a low-carbon electricity system and assert that they are cleaner, safer and more economically sustainable than nuclear. investments) of different countries to nuclear or renewable strategies. A “crowding out” hypothesis: that countries with a greater attachment to nuclear will tend to have a lesser attachment to renewables, and vice versa. Pursuit of nuclear strategies risks taking up resources that could be used more effectively and suppressing the uptake of renewable energy. Thus, per dollar invested, the modularity of renewables projects offers quicker emissions reductions than large-scale, delay-prone, nuclear projects. Energy debates suffer gravely from these syndromes.
