However, it's important not to be discouraged by failure when pursuing a goal or a dream, since failure itself means different things to different people. No one knows what the future holds, so your only guide is whether you can endure repeated defeats and disappointments and still pursue your dream. I know one thing for certain: don't settle for less than what you're capable of, but strive for something bigger. "Two people on a precipice over Yosemite Valley" by Nathan Shipps on Unsplash
Develop A Powerful Vision Of What You Want
"Your problem is to bridge the gap which exists between where you are now and the goal you intend to reach." It's a fact, if you don't know what you want you'll get what life hands you and it may not be in your best interest, affirms author Larry Weidel: "Winners know that if you don't figure out what you want, you'll get whatever life hands you." Focus on your development and if you want to give up, know what's involved before you take the plunge.
