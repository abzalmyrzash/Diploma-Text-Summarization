Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italian Torre Pendente di Pisa, medieval structure in Pisa, Italy, that is famous for the settling of its foundations, which caused it to lean 5.5 degrees (about 15 feet [4.5 metres]) from the perpendicular in the late 20th century. By the early 20th century, however, the heavier bells were silenced, as it was believed that their movement could potentially worsen the towerâ€™s lean.
