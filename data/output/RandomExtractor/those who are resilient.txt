If you settle for less, you will receive less than you deserve and convince yourself you are justified to receive it. Could you be you playing for bigger stakes than you are? Nurture it daily and give it life by taking purposeful action towards it. The more you grow, the more you gain in terms of financial resources, status, success - simple. So become intentional on what you want out of life.
