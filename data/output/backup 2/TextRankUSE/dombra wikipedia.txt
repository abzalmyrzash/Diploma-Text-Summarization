The dombra, also known as dombyra (Kazakh: домбыра, dombyra, Bashkir: думбыра) is a long-necked Kazakh and Bashkir lute and a musical string instrument. The Kazakh dombyra has frets and is played by strumming with the hand or plucking each string individually, with an occasional tap on the main surface of the instrument.
