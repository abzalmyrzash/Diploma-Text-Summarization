I can't tell you what the right course of action is; only you will know. Neither. Those who are resilient stay in the game longer and draw on their inner means to succeed. I've coached many clients who gave up after many years toiling away at their respective goal or dream. No one knows what the future holds, so your only guide is whether you can endure repeated defeats and disappointments and still pursue your dream. I know one thing for certain: don't settle for less than what you're capable of, but strive for something bigger.
