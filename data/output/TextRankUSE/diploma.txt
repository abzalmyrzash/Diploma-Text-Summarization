2.3. A singular value decomposition is applied to the resulting matrix: 𝐴 = 𝑈Σ𝑉𝑇, where 𝑈 = [𝑢𝑖𝑗] is an orthonormal matrix of size 𝑛 × 𝑚, Σ = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔 (𝜎1, 𝜎2, ..., 𝜎𝑚) is a diagonal matrix, 𝑉 = [𝑣𝑖𝑗] is an orthonormal matrix of size 𝑚 × 𝑚. [12]

5.1. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
6.1. Assume we want our compression ratio to be about 10%, i.e., the length of summary is 10 times shorter than the length of article. Are you willing to play bigger even if it means repeated failures and setbacks? So become intentional on what you want out of life. Nurture your dreams. Focus on your development and if you want to give up, know what's involved before you take the plunge. Don't leave your dreams to chance.

Focus on your development and if you want to give up, know what's involved before you take the plunge. I know one thing for certain: don't settle for less than what you're capable of, but strive for something bigger.
