Those who are resilient stay in the game longer and draw on their inner means to succeed. I've coached many clients who gave up after many years toiling away at their respective goal or dream. Gnaw away at your problems until you solve them or find a solution. Similarly, there are no assurances even if you're an overnight sensation, to sustain it for long, particularly if you don't have the mental and emotional means to endure it. This means you must rely on the one true constant in your favour: your personal development. The more you grow, the more you gain in terms of financial resources, status, success - simple.
