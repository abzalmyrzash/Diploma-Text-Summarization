Those Who Are Resilient Stay In The Game Longer
"On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow." To be honest, I don't have the answers. Consider the advice from the American academic and psychologist Angela Duckworth who writes in Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance: "Many of us, it seems, quit what we start far too early and far too often. I know one thing for certain: don't settle for less than what you're capable of, but strive for something bigger. It's a fact, if you don't know what you want you'll get what life hands you and it may not be in your best interest, affirms author Larry Weidel: "Winners know that if you don't figure out what you want, you'll get whatever life hands you." Similarly, there are no assurances even if you're an overnight sensation, to sustain it for long, particularly if you don't have the mental and emotional means to endure it.
