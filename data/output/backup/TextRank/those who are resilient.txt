To be honest, I don't have the answers. However, it's important not to be discouraged by failure when pursuing a goal or a dream, since failure itself means different things to different people. Same failure, yet different responses. I know one thing for certain: don't settle for less than what you're capable of, but strive for something bigger. It's a fact, if you don't know what you want you'll get what life hands you and it may not be in your best interest, affirms author Larry Weidel: "Winners know that if you don't figure out what you want, you'll get whatever life hands you." Focus on your development and if you want to give up, know what's involved before you take the plunge.
