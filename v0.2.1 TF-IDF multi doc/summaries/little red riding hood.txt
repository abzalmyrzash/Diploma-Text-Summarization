This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village. "Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother." He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap. Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you." Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. "Grandmother, what big legs you have!" "Grandmother, what big ears you have!" "Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" "Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!" And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.
