Saturn has fascinated amateurs and professionals alike for centuries. Some scientists speculate that Saturn may be too big. Those moons contribute dust to the rings as well as absorb dust from the rings. A common theory as to how all of the material initially accumulated in Saturn’s rings is a series of asteroid impacts. One other theory holds that the rings of Saturn formed as other moons broke apart in ancient times. No matter which theory you believe, the rings of Saturn are spectacular.
