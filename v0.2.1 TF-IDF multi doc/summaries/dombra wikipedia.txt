The dombra, also known as dombyra (Kazakh: домбыра, dombyra, Bashkir: думбыра) is a long-necked Kazakh and Bashkir lute and a musical string instrument. The instrument differs slightly in different regions. The dumbyra is the equivalent instrument of the Volga Tatars and Bashkirs. For example, the works of Aby Nasyr Al-Farabi refer to a tambur-like musical instrument similar to the dombyra. An instrument similar to the Dombyra existed in almost every country in Central Asia. The National Dombra Day is celebrated in Kazakhstan every first Sunday of July.
