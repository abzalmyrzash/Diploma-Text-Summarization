Extensive work was subsequently done to straighten the tower, and its lean was ultimately reduced to less than 4.0 degrees. This pause allowed the tower’s foundation to settle and likely prevented its early collapse. In 1990 the tower was closed and all the bells silenced as engineers undertook a major straightening project. Engineers expected the tower to remain stable for at least 200 years.
